##Purpose##
This directory is to house any and all code related to project 3.

##Subdirectories##
There is one subdirectory each for NXT-python and ROBOTC. Put code where it 
goes. If we figure out integrated running of compiled robotc programs
from within NXT Python, we may have to change the organization structure
to allow python and ROBOTC code in the same folder, but we will cross that
bridge when we come to it.
